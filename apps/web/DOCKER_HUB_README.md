- 💾 Download processed images instantly

---

## 💡 How to Use the Web Interface

1. **Start the container** (see Quick Start above)
2. **Open http://localhost** in your browser
3. **Drag and drop** your image or click to browse
4. **Wait a few seconds** for processing (~2-5 seconds)
5. **Compare results** with the before/after slider
6. **Download** your image with transparent background

### Optional: Use Pro API for Best Quality

Want even better results? You can easily switch to the Pro API:

## 📊 Version Tags

| Tag | Description | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| `latest` | Latest stable release | Production deployments |
| `1.x.x` | Specific version | Pin to exact version |
| `1.x` | Minor version line | Get patch updates automatically |
| `1` | Major version line | Get all v1.x updates |

**Example:**
```bash
# Always get latest
docker pull withoutbg/app:latest

# Pin to specific version
docker pull withoutbg/app:1.0.0

# Get patch updates for 1.0
docker pull withoutbg/app:1.0
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration & Environment

### Default Settings

- **Port**: 80 (internal container port)
- **Model**: withoutBG Focus v1.0.0 (pre-loaded)
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPEG, WebP
- **Max Upload Size**: 10MB (configurable)
- **Max Images per Upload**: 10 (configurable at build time)

### Custom Port Mapping

```bash
# Run on a different port (e.g., 8080)
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:80 \
  withoutbg/app:latest

# Then access at http://localhost:8080
```

### Change maximum images per upload

The UI defaults to 10 files per batch. To raise or lower it, build the image yourself and set `VITE_MAX_UPLOADS` during the frontend build:

```bash
docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg VITE_MAX_UPLOADS=25 \
  -t withoutbg/app:custom .

docker run -p 80:80 withoutbg/app:custom
```

## 📈 Performance

### Local Processing (Focus Model)

- **First Run**: ~5-10 seconds per image (model initialization)
- **Subsequent Runs**: ~2-5 seconds per image (CPU)
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB RAM
- **Disk Space**: ~320MB (models are pre-loaded in the image)
- **Cost**: Free forever

### Pro API Processing (Optional)

- **Processing Time**: ~1-3 seconds per image
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (processing happens in the cloud)
- **Cost**: Pay per use
- **Quality**: Best-in-class results

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local-First**: All processing with Focus model happens on your server
- **No External Calls**: Your images never leave your server (unless using Pro API)
- **Open Source**: Audit the code yourself
- **Apache 2.0 License**: Commercial-friendly license

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "exec format error" when starting container?

This image is built for **multiple platforms** and should work on all architectures:
- ✅ **linux/amd64** - Intel/AMD CPUs (most servers)
- ✅ **linux/arm64** - Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), AWS Graviton

If you see `exec format error`, Docker may have pulled the wrong architecture:

```bash
# Check what architecture Docker pulled
docker image inspect withoutbg/app:latest | grep Architecture

# Force pull for your platform
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 withoutbg/app:latest  # Intel/AMD
docker pull --platform linux/arm64 withoutbg/app:latest  # ARM/Apple Silicon

# Then run normally
docker run -p 80:80 withoutbg/app:latest
```

### Container won't start?
```bash
# Check logs
docker logs withoutbg

# Check if port 80 is available
docker ps
lsof -i :80  # macOS/Linux
```

### Out of memory?
```bash
# Increase Docker memory limit
# Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory
# Recommended: 4GB+ for smooth operation
```

### Port already in use?
```bash
# Use a different port
docker run -p 8080:80 withoutbg/app:latest
# Then access at http://localhost:8080
```

### API returns errors?
```bash
# Check API health
curl http://localhost/api/health

# View detailed logs
docker logs -f withoutbg
```
